        <p>
          Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into real things. I'm constantly adding new things as I think of them, so, look around. Stay a while. Or don't. I don't care.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, you can view the entire source code of this website <a href='https://github.com/calebrosen/codenamecaleb' target='_blank'>here</a>, if you're interested. Or don't. Like I said, I don't care.
        </p>
